# ToDo
---
A responsive jQuery based ToDo list application with a focus on CSS styling. It features animation effects and has a pretty polished feel overall. The list gets filled with to-do tasks and each element has a hover effect, so a nice little delete button with a trashcan icon appears. Tasks can be managed in two ways: they either get completely deleted off the list or they get checked off and still appear, but as finished tasks. The cross icon at the top right corner is used to toggle the input field, to avoid distraction when you just want to get an overview of your todos.
